- **ADD:**  Manual WiFi default settings in Defines_GSR.h (WiFi_DEF_SSID) for people who want to manually add their always default WiFi at compile time.

- **FIX:**  Fixed minor issues with various menus not giving proper results.
- **FIX:**  Fixed WiFi indicator to show properly.

- **FIX:**  Detect Drift not saving changed value to NVS.
- **FIX:**  Detect Drift now correctly checks 1 minute.  (No more oddities with drift calculations.)

**Version 1.3:**
- **ADD:**  Excessive failover for Detect Travel +/- 30 seconds will cause Watchy to ignore RTC and use internal CPU timing [see Usage]
- **ADD:**  CPU control to improve lifespan of battery operation.  8+ hours of battery while in non-RTC mode, using tailored option changes.
- **FIX:**  Fix WiFi timeouts not properly setup if inside Active Mode for too long.

**Version 1.3.3:**
- **FIX:**  Fixed the restoration of Screen Blanking from storage and restoration from OTA Website.

- **ADD:**  3 new repositories added with branched out functions:  SmallRTC (replacement of WatchyRTC), SmallNTP (industry standard NTP) and Olson2POSIX Timezone collection and setting.

- **FIX:**  Corrected Timezone tests (they were backwards).
- **FIX:**  Changed border from "Show/Hide" to "Light/Dark" to match Display Style.
- **FIX:**  Updated BMA control to properly work with Double Tap, method is there for Wrist tilt, no motion setup for it at present.
- **ADD:**  Functionality to block Non-Volatile Storage from being used, will erase and reboot the Watchy and stop using it for this Watchy face.
- **FIX:**  Corrected NTP server to pool.ntp.org, it should work globally, though it does have a restriction on use, so expect it to fail if used too much.

**Version 1.3.7:**
- **ADD:**  Unified format of main Watchy face, so override can be done to include new fonts and relocation.
- **ADD:**  Functions to allow insertion of override code into certain parts of Watchy_GSR without having to replicate whole sections.
- **FIX:**  Changed icons.h to Icons_GSR.h to remove Watchy.h conflict and also removed steps image.

- **FIX:**  Recognize Countdown Timer is in use during Screen Blanking and not use atMinuteWake, but nextMinuteWake instead.
- **ADD:**  All Screen Blanking now use atMinuteWake when Countdown Timer is not in use, this works by waking at minutes 0 and 30 or the next Alarm minute.
- **FIX:**  makeTime and breakTime introduce a month and week day starting with 1, which is incorrect, versions from SmallRTC & SmallNTP now fix this issue, so January 29 will not be seen as February 29 by the RTCs.

**Version 1.4:**
- **FIX:**  Corrected the orientation of the display with the accelerometer.
- **ADD:**  Added Wrist Tilt support for all Screen Blanking with "Screen on Hold" (actively watches your wrist to turn screen off again, heavy battery usage).

- **ADD:**  Watch Style menu with 1 extra style called "Ballsy".
- **FIX:**  Re-arranged Design Menu setup and included Font.

- **ADD:**  Extra functions (see Override Information) to offer adding or replacing existing Watch Styles without altering the base code.

**Version 1.4.3:**

- **FIX:**  Moved Button PINs to Defines_GSR to a different value from Watchy base's defines to avoid conflicts and to correct them based on RTC and not static.

**Version 1.4.3D:**
- **FIX:**  Fixed the PCF8563 variants so that the UP button will work with both versions, this now requires SmallRTC Version 1.8.

- **ADD:**  Updated GSR.ino to reflect overriding with examples inside that *do* work.
- **FIX:**  Turned VibeTo to false on Deep Sleep to avoid confusion as the motor will turn off then anyways.

**Version 1.4.3J:**
- **FIX:**  Moved the pinMode code until after the setting of the nextMinuteWake to repair the issue with the PCF8563 not waking, thanks to ZeroKelvinKeyboard for the find.

**Version 1.4.4:**
- **FIX:**  Moved all the fonts into 1 font file to reduce clutter.
- **ADD:**  Locale_GSR now contains the English entries for all of the Watchy face text and Webpage text.  (Documentation on adding other languages to follow.)
- **ADD:**  Overriding the Default Menu, so you can USE the Menu button for other things.  10 second hold down of MENU button will force the entry of the default menus.
- **ADD:**  Added a third watch face LCD.
- **FIX:**  Re-added missing Requests test for Active Mode so AskForWiFi() would work properly, missed replacing that after a rollback.
