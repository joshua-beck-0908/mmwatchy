This repo's format:

Bin folder contains the current OTA Bin that you can use a tool to upload with or an OTA Upgrade capable firmware to install the current OTA Bin to the Watchy.

src folder contains a universal (Arduino & PlatformIO) setup for compilation, instructions on how to get it to compile are in the src folder.

Needed libraries:  Arduino Libraries, ArduinoOTA (included in ESP32 2.0.2), SmallRTC (1.6 or greater, GuruSR), SmallNTP (GuruSR), StableBMA (GuruSR), Olson2POSIX (GuruSR) AND Watchy (1.3.3 or greater) base.

**NOTES:**
- Watchy uses version 1.0.6 or *2.0.2* (or possibly higher than *2.0.4*) of the ESP32 libraries, 2.0.0 won't compile, 2.0.3 and 2.0.4 causes a boot crash loop, remove them manually and revert back to version 1.0.6 or use 2.0.2 (which seems to have been fixed).  Recommend using ESP32 2.0.2 until further notice.

**WARNING:**
As of Version 1.4.3H, the Compilation Instructions have changed, the GxEPD2 requires a define to be added to the .h file in the Compilation Instructions or the Dark Border will be disabled.

For instructions on usage of the firmware, see "Usage".

Below is a layout of the Watchy Connect & the OTA Website (used while online your network) that gives you options to various things.

OTA update is **ONLY** possible via an OTA compatible firmware which are:

`Watchy GSR` and those overriding it.

**If you have an OTA upload function in your firmware, ask for it to be added here.**

For those wanting to override the looks of this Watchy face, look at the Override Information.
